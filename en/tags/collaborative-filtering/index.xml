      <description>&lt;p&gt;When the journal IEEE Internet Computing was celebrating its 20th anniversary in 2017, its editorial board selected &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cs.umd.edu/~samir/498/Amazon-Recommendations.pdf&#34;&gt;Amazon.com Recommendations: Item-to-Item Collaborative Filtering&lt;/a&gt;, published in 2003, as the paper that best stood the test of time.&#xA;The paper views traditional collaborative filtering as the approach of finding users similar to the target user and recommending items those users have selected but the user has not.&#xA;Let \(N\) be the number of the items. In the traditional approach, each user is represented as an \(N\)-dimensional vector to measure the similarity between users, the item to item collaborative filtering constructs an \(N\) x \(N\) matrix, where each component represents the similarity between two items.&#xA;By computing the item to item matrix offline, the proposed approach can recommend similar items in time independent of both \(N\) and the number of users \(M\).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In collaborative filtering, Matrix Factorization (MF) approximates the user-item interaction matrix by multiplying the latent matrices for users and items.&#xA;An estimated iteraction is the inner product of the latent vectors for the user and the item.&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.05031.pdf&#34;&gt;Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF)&lt;/a&gt; replaces the inner product with a neural neural network to capture the complex structure of user interaction data.&#xA;There are three instances of NFC: Generalized Matrix Factorization (GMF), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Neural Matrix Factoriation (NeuMF).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
