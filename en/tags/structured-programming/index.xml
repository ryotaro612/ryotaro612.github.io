      <description>After earning her PhD in computer Science at Stanford University, Liskov worked again for MITRE Corporation. She was involved in the development of a time-sharing system called Venus, then was involved in finding ways to address the &amp;ldquo;software crisis.&amp;rdquo; at MITRE. A design methodology for reliable software systems describes a design methodology of structured programming developed as part of the second project.&#xA;The methodology uses testing to guarantee reliability. To test a program, it is necessary to identify relevant test cases, and the set of them must be small enough to implement.</description>
