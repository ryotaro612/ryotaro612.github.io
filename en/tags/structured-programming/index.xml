      <description>&lt;p&gt;After earning her PhD in computer Science at Stanford University, Liskov worked again for MITRE Corporation.&#xA;She was involved in the development of a time-sharing system called Venus, then was involved in finding ways to address the &amp;ldquo;software crisis.&amp;rdquo; at MITRE.&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1479992.1480018&#34;&gt;A design methodology for reliable software systems&lt;/a&gt; describes a design methodology of structured programming developed as part of the second project.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The methodology uses testing to guarantee reliability.&#xA;To test a program, it is necessary to identify relevant test cases, and the set of them must be small enough to implement.&#xA;Structured programming helps to identify the relevant test cases and reduce the number of required test cases by dividing a system into modules.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
