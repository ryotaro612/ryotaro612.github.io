      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cdn.openai.com/research-covers/language-unsupervised/language_understanding_paper.pdf&#34;&gt;Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training&lt;/a&gt; describes the original generative pre-trained transformer model. The paper shows that pre-training on unlabeled text followed by fine-tuning on supervised tasks leads to strong performance. During fine-tuning, the output of the pre-trained model is passed to a linear output layer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The model described in the paper is based on a &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.10198&#34;&gt;multi-layer Transformer decoder&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the architecture in &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.10198&#34;&gt;Attention Is All You Need&lt;/a&gt;, this model uses only the decoder stack. Representations for upstream tasks are constructed so that their format aligns with the unlabeled text used in pre-training. For example, an entailment example is created by concatenating the premise and the hypothesis with a delimiter. A text similarity task also concatenates two texts with a delimiter and feeds the sequence into the pre-trained model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
