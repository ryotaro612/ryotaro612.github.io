      <description>In a distributed system with replicated objects distributed across processes interconnected by an asynchronous network, updating a replica without synchronization can lead to conflicts when the update is sent to other replicas. Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) are data structures whose states form a join semilattice and monotonically non-decreasing across updates. The replicas of CRDTs that have delivered the same updates eventually reach the same state if clents stop submitting updates.</description>
