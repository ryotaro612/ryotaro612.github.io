      <description>&lt;p&gt;Generalized linear models are widely used for large-scale regression and classification problems with sparse inputs because they are simple, scale and interpretable.&#xA;One limitation of interactions or cross-prodcution transformations in generalized linear models is that they do not generalize to query-item feature pairs that have not appeared in the training data.&#xA;Compared with generalized linear models, deep neural networks can improve the diversity of the recommendations.&#xA;Howerver it is difficult to learn effective low-dimentional dense embedding vectors.&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07792&#34;&gt;Wide &amp;amp; Deep Learning for Recommender Systems&lt;/a&gt; jointly trains a generalized linear model and a feed-forward neural network (FFN) to combines their benefits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
