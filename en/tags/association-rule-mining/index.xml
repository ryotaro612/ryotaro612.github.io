      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/170036.170072&#34;&gt;Mining Association Rules between Sets of Items in Large Databases&lt;/a&gt; presents one of the earliest approaches for association rules mining.&#xA;An association rule is an implication of the form \(X \Rightarrow I_j\) where \(X\) is a set of some items, and \(I_j\) is an item that is not in \(X\).&#xA;For instance, if transactions buying bread and butter also buy milk, that forms an association rule.&#xA;The paper introduces a method to find association rules and measure confidence and support factors from transactions.&#xA;The confidence factor measures how many transactions that satisfy \(X\) also satisfy \(I_j\).&#xA;The support factor of an association rule is defined to be the fraction of transactions that contain the union of items in the rule.&#xA;The support factor implies statistical significance of the association rule.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
