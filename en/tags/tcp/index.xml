      <description>&lt;p&gt;Vinton Cerf and Robert Kahn presented a protocol that supports packet communication between hosts in different packet switching networks in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall06/cos561/papers/cerf74.pdf&#34;&gt;A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;The protocol assumes that a Transmission Control Program (TCP) in a host handles the transmission and acceptance of messages on behalf of processes.&#xA;Later, the program was divided into the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP).&#xA;At that time, several protocols that supported exchanging packets between computers were developed, but they assumed the computers were on the same network.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
