    <p>There is doubt that code coverage can measure efficiency of a test suites.
For instance, Winters et al. claimed that an objective code coverage cannnot lead developers to write tests to meet the threashold in a note on code coverage, secition 11.2.4 in <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/software-engineering-at/9781492082781/">Software Engineering at Google</a>.
Additionally, they also claimed code coverage of a test suite cannot ensure the ability of the test suits to detect faults under the tested code.</p>
<p>The above statements are</p>
<!--„Åì„Åì„Åæ„Åß --> 
<p>While such criticisms are often based on logic or anecdotal experience, empirical studies questioning the correlation between test coverage and effectiveness are relatively rare.
Coverage Is Not Strongly Correlated With Test Suite Effectiveness (ICSE 2014) is one such study that was awarded the Most Influential Paper ICSE N-10 at ICSE 2024.
The study investigates the correlation between test coverage and effectiveness in open-source software.</p>
<p>Using mutation analysis, the study evaluated the effectiveness of test cases by measuring how many artificially injected faults they could detect.
The researchers analyzed five large Java projects‚ÄîApache POI, Closure Compiler, HSQLDB, JFreeChart, and Joda Time. The study found a moderate to high correlation between test suite size and effectiveness.
However, when the number of test cases was controlled, the correlation between coverage and effectiveness dropped to low to moderate levels.</p>
<p>To conduct this analysis, the researchers selected projects with at least 100,000 lines of code and over 1,000 test cases.
Additionally, they required projects to use Ant as the build system and JUnit as the testing framework to facilitate automated data collection.</p>
<p>To measure coverage, three types were considered:</p>
<p>C0 (Statement Coverage): The percentage of executed statements.
C1 (Branch Coverage): The percentage of executed branches.
MCC (Modified Condition Coverage): A stricter coverage metric used in aviation safety standards like DO-178B.
Mutation analysis was performed using PIT, which introduces small changes (mutants) to the code, such as modifying constants or logical conditions, to check whether the test suite detects them.</p>
<p>The study measured effectiveness in two ways:</p>
<p>Raw effectiveness: The proportion of all mutants that a test suite detected.
Normalized effectiveness: The proportion of covered mutants that a test suite detected.
A regression analysis using R&rsquo;s lm function showed that test suite size had a moderate to high correlation with effectiveness (adjusted</p>
<p>2
R

values ranging from 0.26 to 0.97).
However, when controlling for test suite size, the correlation between coverage and effectiveness significantly dropped.
The correlation coefficients (Kendall‚Äôs ùúèœÑ) for normalized effectiveness and various coverage metrics showed little variation, suggesting that stricter coverage criteria do not improve the accuracy of effectiveness measurements.</p>
<p>When test suite size was held constant, the correlation between coverage and effectiveness further weakened.
The study&rsquo;s findings indicate that coverage should not be used as a primary measure of test suite effectiveness.
Instead, if developers want a quantitative measure of test suite effectiveness, they should focus on the number of test cases rather than coverage metrics.</p>
<p>This conclusion aligns with the logical critique of coverage mentioned in Software Engineering at Google: just as high coverage does not guarantee effectiveness, having more test cases does not inherently mean better effectiveness.
However, empirical data suggests that test suite size is a better predictor of effectiveness than coverage.</p>
