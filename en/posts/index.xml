      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/170036.170072&#34;&gt;Mining Association Rules between Sets of Items in Large Databases&lt;/a&gt; presents one of the earliest approaches for association rules mining.&#xA;An association rule is an implication of the form \(X \Rightarrow I_j\) where \(X\) is a set of some items, and \(I_j\) is an item that is not in \(X\).&#xA;For instance, if transactions buying bread and butter also buy milk, that forms an association rule.&#xA;The paper introduces a method to find association rules and measure confidence and support factors from transactions.&#xA;The confidence factor measures how many transactions that satisfy \(X\) also satisfy \(I_j\).&#xA;The support factor of an association rule is defined to be the fraction of transactions that contain the union of items in the rule.&#xA;The support factor implies statistical significance of the association rule.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For tasks matching input sequences with labels, current state-of-the-art approaches focus on using &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805&#34;&gt;BERT&lt;/a&gt; models for pre-training.&#xA;Two common encoding approaches are Cross-encoders (&lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08149&#34;&gt;Wolf et al.&lt;/a&gt;), which concatenate input sequences and candidate labels into a single vector, and produce candidate-sensitive embeddings, and Bi-encoders (&lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01984&#34;&gt;Mazar√© et al.&lt;/a&gt;), which encode input sequences and candidate labels separately.&#xA;In Bi-encoders, the score is the dot-product of the two embeddings.&#xA;While Cross-encoders are more accurate than Bi-encoders, Bi-encoders are faster.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A sorting network is a network of comparison elements with 2 indegree and 2 outdegree that sorts a list in ascending or descending order.&#xA;A comparison element receives two numbers and outputs the smaller one to one output and the larger one to the other output.&#xA;Odd-even merging networks and Bitonic sorters are sorting networks proposed in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cs.kent.edu/~batcher/sort.pdf&#34;&gt;Sorting networks and their applications&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;They can sort \(2^p\) elements with \(\ln (\frac{1}{2})p(p+1)\) steps.&#xA;Their processing is independent of the values and is easy to run on the GPU because it does not change the output location in memory based on input data values.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;</description>

      <description>In a distributed system with replicated objects distributed across processes interconnected by an asynchronous network, updating a replica without synchronization can lead to conflicts when the update is sent to other replicas. Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) are data structures whose states form a join semilattice and monotonically non-decreasing across updates. The replicas of CRDTs that have delivered the same updates eventually reach the same state if clents stop submitting updates.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Open-domain question answering (QA) involves answering fact-based questions using documents.&#xA;An open-domain QA system can be divided into two components: one that retrieves relevant passages and another that extracts the answer spans from those passages &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00051&#34;&gt;(Chen et al., 2017)&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;While traditional approaches use sparse vector space models like BM25 for the retrieval step, &lt;a href=&#34;https://aclanthology.org/2020.emnlp-main.550/&#34;&gt;Dense Passage Retrieval for Open-Domain Question Answering&lt;/a&gt; shows that dense representations can also be practically implemented using dense representations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The embeddings are learned from the training dataset, optimizing for maximizing inner products between question and relevant passage vectors.&#xA;The training is essentially metric learning, and each question needs irrelvant passages.&#xA;In experiments, it was found that utilizing both the top passages returned by BM25, excluding the answer, and positive passages paired with other questions as negatives yielded best performance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;</description>

      <description>The CAP theorem, coined by Eric Brewer, states that in a shared-data system, you can have either Consistency (C), Availability (A), or Parition tolerance (P), but not all three simultaneously. However, Martin Kleppmann challenges the CAP theorem and discusses its limitations in Designing Data-Intensive Applications, and A Critique of the CAP Theorem. In CAP Twelve Years Later: How the ‚ÄúRules‚Äù Have Changed, Brewer clarifies that the notion of &amp;ldquo;2 of 3&amp;rdquo; is misleading.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Generalized linear models are widely used for large-scale regression and classification problems with sparse inputs because they are simple, scale and interpretable.&#xA;One limitation of interactions or cross-prodcution transformations in generalized linear models is that they do not generalize to query-item feature pairs that have not appeared in the training data.&#xA;Compared with generalized linear models, deep neural networks can improve the diversity of the recommendations.&#xA;Howerver it is difficult to learn effective low-dimentional dense embedding vectors.&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07792&#34;&gt;Wide &amp;amp; Deep Learning for Recommender Systems&lt;/a&gt; jointly trains a generalized linear model and a feed-forward neural network (FFN) to combines their benefits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://ryotaro.dev/en/posts/a_protocol_for_packet_network_intercommunication/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Vinton Cerf and Robert Kahn presented a protocol that supports packet communication between hosts in different packet switching networks in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall06/cos561/papers/cerf74.pdf&#34;&gt;A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;The protocol assumes that a Transmission Control Program (TCP) in a host handles the transmission and acceptance of messages on behalf of processes.&#xA;Later, the program was divided into the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP).&#xA;At that time, several protocols that supported exchanging packets between computers were developed, but they assumed the computers were on the same network.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://wordvec.colorado.edu/papers/Deerwester_1990.pdf&#34;&gt;Latent Semantic Analysis&lt;/a&gt; approximates an original term-document matrix by singular value decomposition (SVD).&#xA;The components consist of the frequencies with which each term occurred in each document.&#xA;The Latent Semantic Analysis thresholds all but the largest \(K\) singular values to zero.&#xA;The left singular vectors are a \(t \times K\) matrix, and the transpose of the right singular vectors are a \(K\times d\) matrix where \(t\) is the number of the terms and \(d\) is the number of the documents.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://sigir.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/p211.pdf&#34;&gt;Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing&lt;/a&gt; (PLSI) is a generative model that associates each term and document with an unobserved class variable \(z \in \mathcal{Z} = \{z_1,\dots , z_K\}\).&#xA;The likelihoods of the documents and terms are estimated by the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, and the joint probability model \(\textbf{P}\) can be written as \(\textbf{P}=\hat{\textbf{U}}\hat{\Sigma}\hat{\textbf{V}}^t\) where \(\hat{\textbf{U}}=(P(d_i|z_k))_{i, k}\), \(\hat{\textbf{V}}=(P(w_j|z_k))_{j, k}\), \(\hat{\Sigma}=\text{diag} (P(z_k))_k\).&#xA;Compared to the Latent Semantic Analysis, the components of \(\textbf{P}\) have a clear probabilistic meaning in terms of mixture component distributions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LoRA: LOW-RANK ADAPTATION OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS</title>

      <pubDate>Sat, 18 Nov 2023 12:21:20 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid>https://ryotaro.dev/en/posts/lora-low-rank-adaptation-of-large-language-models/</guid>
      <description>LoRA is inspired by Li et al. (2018) and Aghajanyan et al. (2020) which show that the learned over-parameterized models reside on a low intrinsic dimension. An intrinsic dimension is the minimum number of parameters needed to reach a satisfactory solution to the objective. LoRA injects weight matrices into each attention layer of the Transformer architecture instead of fine-tuning the pre-trained model weights. The injected weight matrices are rank decomposition matrices, and LoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks.</description>

      <description>After earning her PhD in computer Science at Stanford University, Liskov worked again for MITRE Corporation. She was involved in the development of a time-sharing system called Venus, then was involved in finding ways to address the &amp;ldquo;software crisis.&amp;rdquo; at MITRE. A design methodology for reliable software systems describes a design methodology of structured programming developed as part of the second project.&#xA;The methodology uses testing to guarantee reliability. To test a program, it is necessary to identify relevant test cases, and the set of them must be small enough to implement.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://machinelearning.org/archive/icml2008/papers/391.pdf&#34;&gt;A Unified Architecture for Natural Language Processing&lt;/a&gt; is an instance of multitask learning.&#xA;The first layer is a lookup table that stores embeddings of a fixed dictionary and size.&#xA;The second layer is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/waibelTDNN.pdf&#34;&gt;Time-Delay Neural Networks&lt;/a&gt; layer.&#xA;It extracts features from the sentence treating it as a sequence with local structure.&#xA;The third layer takes the maximum value for each of the output features of the second layer over time.&#xA;The following layers are classical NN layers.&#xA;The lookup-table is shared among the tasks, and the other layers can be task specific to each task.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>In Transmission of Information, Hartley developed a quantitative measure of &amp;ldquo;information&amp;rdquo; in 1927. Hartley claims that information is the outcome of a selection among a finite set of possible messages. Shannon&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;A mathematical theory of communication&amp;rdquo;, which is based in part on Hartley&amp;rsquo;s ideas, published in 1947. Hartley did not model the source of information probabilistically. Shannon modeled the source of information as a random process.&#xA;Hartley stated that information should be proportional to the number of selections for practical engineering value.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.11692.pdf&#34;&gt;RoBERTa&lt;/a&gt;(Robusty optimized BERT approach) is an improved recipe for training &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf&#34;&gt;BERT&lt;/a&gt; models.&#xA;BERT uses two objectives, masked language modeling and next sequence prediction (NSP), during pretraining.&#xA;RoBERTa uses masked language modeling only.&#xA;The authors increased the batch size and Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) vocabulary size.&#xA;RobERTa is trained with byte-level BPE, which uses bytes instead of unicode characters as the base subword units.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Edgar Djkstra criticized the excessive use of the go to statement in &lt;a href=&#34;https://homepages.cwi.nl/~storm/teaching/reader/Dijkstra68.pdf&#34;&gt;Go To Statement Considered Harmful&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;While the source code is static, the process taking place under the control of the source code is dynamic.&#xA;The programmers should aim to shorten the conceptual gap between the source code and its process to describe the progress.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The authors of &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02155.pdf&#34;&gt;Self-Attention with Relative Position Representations&lt;/a&gt; presented a way of injecting relative position representations in the self-attention mechanism of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf&#34;&gt;Transformer&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;In contrast to recurrent and convolutional neural networks, Transformer does not explicitly model position information in its structure.&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf&#34;&gt;The original position encoding&lt;/a&gt; employs sine and cosine functions of different frequencies.&#xA;The authors of Transformer hypothesized that sinusoidal position encodings would help Transformer to generalize to sequence lengths unseen during training.&#xA;Positional encodings are added to the input embeddings at the bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks of Transformer.&#xA;This hypothesis was shared by the relative position representations.&#xA;In contrast to absolute position representations, the relative position representations are invariant to the total sequence length.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The authors of Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text-to-Text Transformer performed experiments with Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer(T5), a unified framework for NLP. The basic idea underlying T5 is to treat various NLP problems as taking text as input and producing new text as output. Their goal is to explore general language learning abilities instead of providing new methods. They are interested in exploring the limits of transfer learning for NLP by scaling up models and data sets beyond what has previously been considered.</description>

      <title>Catalan Numbers(2016)</title>

      <description>The Catalan numbers are a sequence of natural numbers that occur in various problems in combinatorial mathematics. For example, the number of expressions containing \(n\) valid pairs of parentheses is the \(n\)th Catalan number. Suppose you have a grid of \(n \times n\) squares, the \(n\)th Catalan number represents the number of paths with a length of \(2n\) that lead from the upper left corner to the lower right corner without intersecting the diagonal dotted line running from the upper left to the lower right.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://scheme2006.cs.uchicago.edu/11-ghuloum.pdf&#34;&gt;An Incremental Approach to Compiler Construction&lt;/a&gt; shows an incremental approach to build a compiler that accepts a large subset of the Scheme programming language.&#xA;The compiler produces assembly code for the Intel-X86 architecture.&#xA;Because real-life compilers are too complex to serve as an educational tool, the gap between real-life compilers and the educational toy compilers is too wide.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal of the paper is to break the barrier.&#xA;The development of the compiler is broken down into 24 incremental steps.&#xA;Every step yields a fully working compiler for progressively expanding a subset of Scheme.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
